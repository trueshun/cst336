                     <h2>In-Depth</h2>
                     There are two cameras indicated by the orange squares. These two send images to the computer for processing
                     via a high-speed USB interface which is indicated by the red square. The USB interface is capable of transferring 
                     data at 5 Gbps. There is a coil and capacitor to create a voltage boost converter which regulates the power 
                     supplied to the Infrared (IR) emitters, indicated by the yellow rectangle. The high-output emitters illuminate 
                     the area around  the Leap Motion controllers. These IR emitters provide the light that reflects off of the hands
                     back into the camera modules, these are indicated by the purple squares.

                    The heart of the Leap Motion controller are the 2 cameras and 3 Infrared LEDs. These two components can track infrared 
                    light with a wavelength of 850 nanometers. Because of its wide angle lenses, the device has a viewing range of 2 ft. The 
                    USB interface then reads the sensor data into its own local memory and is then sent to the Leap Motion tracking software 
                    via USB. The data at this point takes the form of a greyscale stereo image, separated into the left and right cameras.

                <div id="techtext3">
                    Once the image has been sent to the computer, the Orion software applies advanced algorithms to the raw sensor data.
                    The images are analyzed to construct a 3D representation of what the controller sees. Then the tracking layer matches the data
                    to extract tracking information like fingers and tools. The Leap Motion Service then sends the results - usually a series of frames or
                    snapshots that contain all the tracking data - into a transport protocol. This protocol is how the service communicates with the
                    Leap Motion Control Panel as well as native and web client libraries. This client library then organizes the data into object-oriented API
                    structure, and from there the application logic ties into the Leap Motion input which allows for a motion-controlled experience.
