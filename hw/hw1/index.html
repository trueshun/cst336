                    <h2>What is Leap Motion?</h2>
                    
                        Leap Motion is a sensor device that tracks a user's discrete finger movements that can be used with or without a 
                        virtual reality headset. Using LEDs to create an area in front of the user and infrared sensors to pick up the 
                        reflected hand movements, Leap Motion sends the data through a USB cable to the host computer. Leap Motion has 
                        been used in applications such as Ethereal, which allows users to "paint" with their fingers in VR or Gravity 
                        Sketch's 3D modeling. Leap Motion's newest update, <span>Orion</span>, furthers Leap Motion's VR capability.  
                        <br /> <br />
                        The Leap Motion controller captures 2-D images and uses them to create a model of 3-D space. The components in 
                        the controller are designed to illuminate hands, capture images of those hands, and then send the images to the 
                        computer for processing.
