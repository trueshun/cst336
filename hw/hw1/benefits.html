                    Leap Motion could potentialy be integrated into medical computers through which doctors can perform complicated and delicate operations
                    across continents, the Leap Motion controller can also be collaborated to remove the normal shake that surgeons have to a certain degree.

                    Architects and designers can really benefit from this by getting the freedom they have always wanted when it comes to 3D 
                    modelling and 3D graphics. They can turn, scale and fully transform objects without having to use a physical 2D controller
                    (e.g. mouse, keyboard, trackpad), thus saving precious time and allowing more creativity.
